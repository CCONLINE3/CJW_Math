# Robot Math Library Based on CoI and SE3

- The library contains functions based on CoI and basic operations on SE3.

- The class template is CJW_Math, which uses arrays to store matrices. Pose calculations use simplified element operations to speed up calculations.

# The library includes the following features:

1. vectors & matrices display.

2. Three-dimensional vector and six-dimensional matrix operations.

3. Basic matrix operations:

    - QR decomposition of square matrices.

    - Determinant of square matrices.

    - Eigenvectors and eigenmatrices of symmetric matrices.

    - SVD decomposition of matrices.

    - Inverse matrix based on Gauss algorithmic.

4. General operations of rotation matrices of rigid body.

5. General operations of posture matrices of rigid body.

6. Attitude expression switching

7. General operations of posture matrix based on exponential coordinates.

8. Adjoint transformation of posture matrices and their Spinor.

9. Differential operations of posture matrices based on exponential coordinates.

10. Spinor conversion of rigid body posture matrix, velocity and exponential mapping

11. PD control of posture matrix of rigid body based on exponential coordinates.

12. Coordinate transformation of generalized inertia matrix.

13. Dynamic equations based on inertial center.

14. Boolean operations on sets.
